Why QuickDB?
------------

QuickDB is a light weight database for python, with a simple API and a simple file format. It is not meant to be a full 
featured database, but rather a simple way to store data in a file. It's written in python, and is compatible with python 
3.6 and above. The main goal of QuickDB is to provide a simple, faster and easy to use database for python developers.
